<li>Choose activities you like to do. You'll be more likely to stick with something you enjoy. Think about whether you like to be inside or outside, alone or with people and what time of day is best for you. </li> <br>
<li>Find a partner -- you're more likely to keep up with your new routine. </li> <br>
<li>Congratulate yourself for all the good things you've done for your body and get started again as soon as your schedule allows. </li> <br>
<li>Vary your routine. You may be less likely to get bored if you try different activities. Walk one day; bicycle the next. </li> <br>
<li>Commit to a realistic schedule. You might want to vary the times and locations of your activities, to keep things interesting - unless you're more comfortable with a set, predictable schedule, which is fine too! </li> <br>
<li>Sneak in a few minutes of physical activity whenever you can. Take a 10-minute walk after you eat lunch and before you start back to work. </li> <br>
